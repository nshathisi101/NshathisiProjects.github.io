										<h2 class="major">Masa Mobile Application</h2>
										<p>The intelligent mobile application categorizes threats into three classes: 
											normal, medium, and high. If the mobile application identifies hate keywords 
											at a low pitch say 1000hz it allows parties involved a chance to resolve 
											issues by themselves, higher pitch triggers various levels of assistance 
											starting from the 5 trusted emergency contacts, ending with police interference respectively. 
											One of the supporting features of the intelligent mobile application is that it 
											provides a platform where victims of Gender Based Violence can discuss 
											issues among themselves anonymously and with a choice of involving 
											social workers. Lastly, the mobile application provides a platform for organizationâ€™s that help victims of GBV to also intervene and share success 
											stories from previous cases

											This soluction won the 2020 National Science Week & Stem Hackathon get first place

										<h2 class="major">Mpatisa Ntlo</h2>
										<p>Real estate shopping is rapidly becoming a significant shopping activity. Landlords advertise their 
											properties on social media platforms while prospective tenants search for property on social media. 
											Prospective tenants spend hours collecting and reviewing various real estate advertising 
											publications. The information that is on social media is diverse and unstructured, separating social 
											media information according to a particular domain is a challenging task. Conducting a search 
											process to find relevant information on social media can be a complex task. Most existing tools 
											used to search for information are widely inadequate since they do not personalize data. Most users 
											do not know how to map their preferences to a query that finds a match that closely meet their 
											requirements. </p>
